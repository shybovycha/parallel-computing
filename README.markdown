# Parallel Computing

## What's going on?

This is just a set of simple problems, being solved with both serial _(or usual, plain, bare - call it whatever you want)_ and parallel programming.

There are three (for now) versions of code - written in different programming languages:

* Ruby
* C
* Haskell

Each of them is interesting by itself and contains some nice parts.
